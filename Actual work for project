Introduction-
This case study is examining the growth and history of facebook. An important distinction is that we are looking at Facebook the company, currently known as Meta, as opposed to the application facebook, though they are intrinsically linked so there will be some overlap. Facebook has been at the forefront of social media for nearly the last two decades. Though in the modern-day, it as a social media is seen as for older people, you cant deny how important meta is for social media as a whole. Meta own Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and messenger, as well as whole lot of other companies.
We will analyse this growth and change through the lens of business and societal impacts. Meta made billions, with all four of its founders being billionaires respectfully and Facebook changed society as a whole. It was so successful as it wasn’t sold, which happened to many other precursors, which then saw a dip in users as the sites were seen as a way for profit.
Facebook timeline- Febuary 2004- Facebook is launched, though its precursor named 'Facemash' was made the year prior. while its precursor was designed as an app purely to rate people based on looks, Facebook also included peoples personal information.
March 2004-2005- Facebook, at the time called theFacebook, takes off in popularity, while first being exclusively for Harvard students, within the year, it became available to most universities in the US and Canada(2) and became its own project, moving its headquarters across the country to California.
2006- Facebook becomes publicly available, with anyone above the age of 13 with an email account having access. It also introduces its news feature.
2007-2012- Facebook is officially the biggest social media in the world, it is valued at around 15 billion dollars(3). Facebook went public on the stock market in 2012.
2012-2014- Facebook goes on a spree of buying other companies, purchasing Instagram, Whatsapp and Oculus VR.
2018- Facebook illegally used data to sway elections.
Modern day- Facebook, now as a company going by meta, though still having facebook as an offshoot of it is ranked the 6th biggest company in the world, with a market cap of 1.1 trillion USD.(4)
Key People-
Mark Zuckerberg- the most famously involved person in facebook. one of the founders and the Longtime CEO. He is likely the first name that you think about when you hear the word Facebook.
Eduardo saverin- Another original founder of facebook, was the first investor. he would go on to found investment company B Capital.
Dustin Moskovitz- The main coder at the beginning. He worked in facebook for 4 years before he opened asana, his own company. Due to his stake in facebook, he was reported to be the youngest self-made billionaire in 2011
Sean Parker- Originally created Napster, he became the first president of Facebook and led their expansion.
Peter Thiel- The first outside investor in Facebook. He invested 500,000 as it was expanding.
Frances Haugen- A whistle-blower, released key details about facebook privacy concerns, leading to a scandal.
Andrew Bozworth- Current CEO of facebook the company, longtime proponent of AR/VR.
Chris Cox- The main person behind many of facebooks ideas, such as integrating instagram, and Zuckerberg’s most trusted advisor
Facebook’s business side has done an incredible job at monetising a global social network, and its financial engine is both massive and complex. At its core, Facebook (now Meta) makes most of its money through advertising: in Q2 2025, for example, Meta reported total revenue of 47.52 billion, of which 46.6 billion came from ads on its main apps of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. (6) In that quarter, ad impressions grew by 11% year over year, and the average price per ad climbed by 9%, pointing to both higher engagement and stronger demand from advertisers. (6) According to Mark Zuckerberg in the Q2 Conference call(7), 3.4 billion people used a core app daily, which is about 800 million short of half of the world using daily. From a business standpoint, Facebook’s scale gives it unique leverage: because so many people use its apps, advertisers will want to be there, and will pay a lot of money to be seen there. That’s how Facebook can charge so much for its ads, especially when its new AI systems help make ads more efficient and effective, something Meta has leaned into heavily. According to its Q2 2025 earnings, much of the growth in ad revenue was more ads being shown to those who were interested via AI-driven recommendation models. (8) The result is not just more ads being shown, but more valuable ads, which has shown to have made Facebook a lot of money. Facebook doesn’t just make money from ads. In the last quarter, they made 583 million from mostly paid messages and subscriptions, which is up about 50% in the last year(7). While 583 million is a lot of money, compared to its ad business, these other sources don’t matter, reinforcing how Facebook is still, first and foremost, an advertising company. The company is also returning a lot of value to shareholders: in Q2 2025, Facebook spent 9.76 billion on buying back shares and paid out 1.33 billion in dividends (6) This shows that, besides growing its business, Facebook is very focused on rewarding its investors. Facebook’s business is not without risks, and its strategy shows some of the trade-offs it’s making. On one hand, it is investing in infrastructure, in Q2 2025 it spent 17.01 billion on it, which signals that the company is preparing for a future with more AI, more data demand, and possibly more hardware.(6) On the other hand, some of its business practices are coming under scrutiny: internal documents recently revealed that a significant portion of Facebook’s revenue may come from “high-risk” ads, including potential scams or fraudulent content. According to those documents, Facebook projected that around 10% of its 2024 revenue (roughly 16 billion) came from such suspect ads. (9) This is not only an ethical issue as it could lead to fines or reputational risk, which impacts the business. Another key part of Facebook’s business is its ambition to finance its future via newer, less mature segments. Reality Labs, Facebook’s division for virtual and augmented reality, loses money, even as the rest of the company is profiting. In Q2 2025, Reality Labs contributed 370 million in revenue, but its operating loss was $4.53 billion over the same period. (6) this isn’t a pure loss, as Facebook is effectively gambling on Reality Labs to do well in the future. Facebook’s business model also has geopolitical and regulatory risk baked into it: being so dependent on advertising means it’s very exposed to changing ad market conditions, regulatory crackdowns, and competition. For instance, regional growth is uneven, in its Q2 2025 reporting, Facebook noted that ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and outside of north-America markets. (7) Meanwhile, it has to navigate complex data-privacy laws and antitrust scrutiny in many markets. And because it’s such a huge player, any misstep in policy or execution can lead to major problems for them. Facebook is still financially very healthy. In Q2 2025, its operating income was 20.44 billion, a 38% increase year over year, despite rising infrastructure and staffing costs. (10) Its free cash flow for that quarter was 8.55 billion, which gives it a lot of flexibility to invest, return money to shareholders, or absorb short-term hits in riskier bets, such as with Reality Labs. In addition to investing in infrastructure and paying back shareholders, Facebook is trying to use Ai as much as possible, not just for making ads better, but also to power future products. This is a core part of its strategy: by using large-scale AI, Facebook can potentially increase ad efficiency, improve the relevance of content, and reduce costs. Analysts on Wall Street have noted that Facebook positioning itself as a major AI-driven company could be a big long-term advantage. From a competitive standpoint, Facebook dominates the social advertising market. In 2024, Meta (Facebook’s parent) accounted for 60% of all social-app revenue worldwide, generating around $160 billion from social-app ads. While that is a massive share, which gives them incredible leverage in the social advertising space, they cant become complacent and let apps such as TikTok get a higher share of the market. Finally, Facebook’s business has a potential problem. it is massively profitable today, but its long-term vision depends on risky, capital-intensive bets which could fail. The Reality Labs losses show that Facebook is willing to reinvest a significant portion of its cash into projects that may pay off years from now. At the same time, its core ad business is sustaining overwhelmingly strong cash flow, giving it room to make those bets. This makes Facebook’s financial model very well managed. In short, from a business perspective, Facebook is a juggernaut: it monetises an enormous global user base through advertising, returns value to shareholders, and invests heavily in the future through AI and metaverse infrastructure. But it also carries big risks, from regulatory scrutiny to potentially shady ad practices to long-term losses in its high-risk innovation projects. How well Facebook navigates that mix will likely determine whether it remains a dominant force, or stumbles and loses its spot as one of the biggest companies in the world.
Facebook has made an ethical impact on society that can be seen as both positive and negative. On the plus side, Facebook's platforms have connected billions of people around the world, allowing friends and families to stay in touch and providing individuals with the ability to find communities they may not have access to offline. These networks have enabled emotional support, rapid information sharing during crises, and large-scale social mobilization-from fundraising to activism to disaster relief. Research from the Oxford Internet Institute even suggests that Facebook use is not universally harmful and may, for some, provide mental-health support by offering access to peer groups and spaces for expression. The major economic opportunities created by Meta's tools are undeniable: small businesses, creators, and entrepreneurs rely on the company's targeted advertising to reach customers efficiently, especially in developing economies. Its investments in AI and virtual reality spur technological innovation, opening up new possibilities for learning, collaboration, and creative work.
Yet there are still significant ethical problems to consider: collecting a lot  of user data can always lead to problems, and collection data happens to be something that Facebook does frequently. This has raised serious questions around privacy, consent, and surveillance for facebook throughout the years; previous scandals like Cambridge Analytica underlined how easily such data is exploited, and it has been argued that Facebook exploits user trust and cognitive biases to gather much more information than users realize. The psychological manipulativeness of the designs on its platforms-infinite scroll, likes, and algorithmic feeds can lead to addictive behavior, particularly among teenagers on sites such as instagram. Researchers and regulators have sounded the alarm over increased anxiety, depression, and social comparison among young users, while the EU is probing whether Meta's platforms are inherently unsafe for minors. Meanwhile, the spread of misinformation, extremist content, and hate speech on Meta's networks has had real-world impacts, including reports like Amnesty International's study of Myanmar demonstrating how algorithms on Facebook surfaced and promoted lethal content that fueled violence. The situation may get worse as Meta decided to stop its focus on fact checking content. Concerns also reach to child safety in virtual reality spaces, where whistleblowers accused Meta of suppressing internal research and failing to protect minors.
These are issues that raise larger questions of responsibility and accountability. Facebook has immense influence over public discourse, political processes, and social behavior, with billions affected by design decisions made by a handful of executives. Critics claim that regulatory fines and promises from the podium are too often met with superficial changes, rather than more fundamental, core changes. As Facebook continues its expansion into immersive technologies and AI-driven systems, the stakes only ratchet upward. Along with the undeniable benefits it brings-connection, creativity, information, and opportunity-come grave ethical responsibilities. To move ahead responsibly, Meta needs to increase transparency, improve data governance, rethink harmful design patterns, and create systems of independent oversight. The challenge is not only to innovate but to do so in ways which respect user dignity and protect the wellbeing of communities worldwide.
Facebook has had a pretty messy history with data-leaking scandals, and honestly, they’ve done a lot to earn the reputation. When people talk about “Facebook and privacy,” the first thing that usually comes to mind is the Cambridge Analytica mess back in 2018. Even though it’s been years, it’s still the defining example of how badly things can go when a company collects tons of personal info and doesn’t really control what happens to it. Basically, a third-party researcher created a personality quiz app and Facebook allowed it to collect not only the data of the people who took the quiz, but also the data of their friends without their permission. That all added up to the information of around 87 million users getting harvested and passed to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that used the data to target voters. Facebook said it didn’t realize what was happening, but a lot of people felt like the company was either careless or just didn’t care enough to notice. The fallout was huge: congressional hearings, millions in fines, and a massive hit to public trust.
But Cambridge Analytica was really just the start of the public fully waking up to how Facebook handles data. Over the next few years, a bunch of smaller but still worrying incidents popped up. There was the time when hundreds of millions of Facebook passwords were found stored in plain text inside the company  which sounds unbelievable for a tech giant, but it happened. The passwords weren’t leaked publicly, but the fact that any Facebook employee could look at them was enough to freak people out. Around the same time, security researchers found that Facebook user data including account names, IDs, and interactions  had been sitting out in the open on unprotected Amazon cloud servers managed by third-party partners. These weren’t hackers breaking into Facebook; these were basically Facebook’s business partners not locking the front door, and Facebook not keeping track of what its partners were doing with the data.
Then there was the incident where Facebook admitted it had accidentally uploaded the contact lists of millions of users, including some people who didn’t even have Facebook accounts. And the time it was discovered that Facebook had been collecting call logs and SMS metadata from Android phones for years  supposedly with permission, but most users had no idea they were agreeing to something that invasive. Every time one of these stories broke, Facebook would say it was an accident or a misunderstanding, but after a while, it got harder for people to believe the company just kept slipping up that often.
What makes all of this worse is that Facebook’s entire business runs on data. They don’t sell your information directly, but the more they know about you  your habits, your interests, your location, your relationships  the better they can target ads, which is where the company makes almost all its money. So when data ends up leaking, even if it’s because of a random partner company or a software glitch, people naturally assume Facebook wasn’t protecting their information enough because it was too busy trying to make use of it.
All of the scandals together painted a picture of a company that collected huge amounts of data first and asked questions later. Even when Facebook tightened its API rules and released big statements about privacy, users were still left wondering how much the company really changed. The biggest impact wasn’t just fines or lawsuits  it was the feeling that people couldn’t fully trust Facebook with personal information anymore. Even today, whenever news breaks about a breach, even if it’s unrelated, Facebook is the first name people think of. The data-leak scandals didn’t just expose technical problems; they exposed cultural ones. They showed how dangerous it is when a company grows so fast and gets so powerful that it loses track of how people’s data is handled. And once trust is broken like that, it’s incredibly hard to rebuild.
The societal impacts of Facebook
The societal impacts of facebook have been so noticeable over the last few years from when it began in 2004 to where it is today in the world it has changed how everything works how we communicate, socialize, privacy, politics it has also had effects on our personal well being bellow is facebooks societal impacts
1.	Communication & Social Connectivity
Positive Impacts:
Global connection: Facebook allowed people across the world to stay in touch instantly helping geographical divides
Community building: Users could find and build communities based on shared interests, identities, or experiences e.g gaming groups, certain hobbies
Reconnecting relationships: Made it easier to find old friends classmates, and distant family members.
Negative Impacts:
Superficial interactions: Online friendships often replaced deeper, face to face connections.
Social isolation: Alot of screen time and artificial connection can lead to anxiety and social shyness when it comes to face to face interaction.
2.	Psychological and Mental Health Effects
Negative Impacts:
Social comparison: Users often compare their real lives to others unrealistic and not normal lives and get stuck in a comparison of someone’s fake life to there own real one.
Addiction: Features like infinite scrolling and notifications are designed to increase time spent on the platform, leading to digital dependency.
Cyberbullying & harassment: The platforms have made it easy to be cyber bullied and harassed and also make it alot easier for the bully to say more hurtful things and do more hurtful things as there is no face to face interaction it can nearly feel fake
Mixed Impacts:
Validation & self-worth: Likes and comments can temporarily boost confidence but can also lead to dependence on external approval from other people and be subject to there options
