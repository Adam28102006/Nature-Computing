Facebook’s business side has done an incredible job at monetising a global social network, and its financial engine is both massive and complex. At its core, Facebook (now Meta) makes most of its money through advertising: in Q2 2025, for example, Meta reported total revenue of 47.52 billion, of which 46.6 billion came from ads on its main apps of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. (1) In that quarter, ad impressions grew by 11% year over year, and the average price per ad climbed by 9%, pointing to both higher engagement and stronger demand from advertisers. (1) According to Mark Zuckerberg in the Q2 Conference call(2), 3.4 billion people used a core app daily, which is about 800 million short of half of the world using daily.
From a business standpoint, Facebook’s scale gives it unique leverage: because so many people use its apps, advertisers will want to be there, and will pay a lot of money to be seen there. That’s how Facebook can charge so much for its ads, especially when its new AI systems help make ads more efficient and effective, something Meta has leaned into heavily. According to its Q2 2025 earnings, much of the growth in ad revenue was more ads being shown to those who were interested via AI-driven recommendation models. (3) The result is not just more ads being shown, but more valuable ads, which has shown to have made Facebook a lot of money.
Facebook doesn’t just make money from ads. In the last quarter, they made 583 million from mostly paid messages and subscriptions, which is up about 50% in the last year(2). While 583 million is a lot of money, compared to its ad business, these other sources don’t matter, reinforcing how Facebook is still, first and foremost, an advertising company.
The company is also returning a lot of value to shareholders: in Q2 2025, Facebook spent 9.76 billion on buying back shares and paid out 1.33 billion in dividends (1) This shows that, besides growing its business, Facebook is very focused on rewarding its investors.
Facebook’s business is not without risks, and its strategy shows some of the trade-offs it’s making. On one hand, it is investing in infrastructure, in Q2 2025 it spent  17.01 billion on it, which signals that the company is preparing for a future with more AI, more data demand, and possibly more hardware.(1) On the other hand, some of its business practices are coming under scrutiny: internal documents recently revealed that a significant portion of Facebook’s revenue may come from “high-risk” ads, including potential scams or fraudulent content. According to those documents, Facebook projected that around 10% of its 2024 revenue  (roughly 16 billion) came from such suspect ads. (4) This is not only an ethical issue as it could lead to fines or reputational risk, which impacts the business.
Another key part of Facebook’s business is its ambition to finance its future via newer, less mature segments. Reality Labs, Facebook’s division for virtual and augmented reality, loses money, even as the rest of the company is profiting. In Q2 2025, Reality Labs contributed 370 million in revenue, but its operating loss was $4.53 billion over the same period. (1) this isn’t a pure loss, as Facebook is effectively gambling on Reality Labs to do well in the future.
Facebook’s business model also has geopolitical and regulatory risk baked into it: being so dependent on advertising means it’s very exposed to changing ad market conditions, regulatory crackdowns, and competition. For instance, regional growth is uneven, in its Q2 2025 reporting, Facebook noted that ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and outside of north-America markets. (2) Meanwhile, it has to navigate complex data-privacy laws and antitrust scrutiny in many markets. And because it’s such a huge player, any misstep in policy or execution can lead to major problems for them.
Facebook is still financially very healthy. In Q2 2025, its operating income was 20.44 billion, a 38% increase year over year, despite rising infrastructure and staffing costs. (5) Its free cash flow for that quarter was 8.55 billion, which gives it a lot of flexibility to invest, return money to shareholders, or absorb short-term hits in riskier bets, such as with Reality Labs. 
In addition to investing in infrastructure and paying back shareholders, Facebook is trying to use Ai as much as possible, not just for making ads better, but also to power future products. This is a core part of its strategy: by using large-scale AI, Facebook can potentially increase ad efficiency, improve the relevance of content, and reduce costs. Analysts on Wall Street have noted that Facebook positioning itself as a major AI-driven company could be a big long-term advantage. 
From a competitive standpoint, Facebook dominates the social advertising market. In 2024, Meta (Facebook’s parent) accounted for 60% of all social-app revenue worldwide, generating around $160 billion from social-app ads. While that is a massive share, which gives them incredible leverage in the social advertising space, they cant become complacent and let apps such as TikTok get a higher share of the market.
Finally, Facebook’s business has a potential problem. it is massively profitable today, but its long-term vision depends on risky, capital-intensive bets which could fail. The Reality Labs losses show that Facebook is willing to reinvest a significant portion of its cash into projects that may pay off years from now. At the same time, its core ad business is sustaining overwhelmingly strong cash flow, giving it room to make those bets. This makes Facebook’s financial model very well managed.
In short, from a business perspective, Facebook is a juggernaut: it monetises an enormous global user base through advertising, returns value to shareholders, and invests heavily in the future through AI and metaverse infrastructure. But it also carries big risks, from regulatory scrutiny to potentially shady ad practices to long-term losses in its high-risk innovation projects. How well Facebook navigates that mix will likely determine whether it remains a dominant force,  or stumbles and loses its spot as one of the biggest companies in the world.
